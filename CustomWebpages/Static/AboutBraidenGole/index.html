                            Hi my name is Braiden and I originally started my programming journey on my own. I first attempted to learn C++ and quickly realized that C++
                            was going to be too challenging at the time so I migrated to learning the programming language "Python”. I started off with YouTube videos and 
                            then I found platforms such as: <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/home">SoloLearn</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/?utm_source=adwords-brand&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=Brand_Udemy_CA&utm_term=_._ag_69218825991_._ad_460506692606_._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_kwd-310556426868_._li_1002359_._pd__._&utm_term=_._pd__._kw_udemy_._&matchtype=e&gclid=CjwKCAjwt8uGBhBAEiwAayu_9V2pBdkrNN8wBhPgwGyhtCDP_Yr1M9kCvRlXYAy7GfaOwMrouijTQhoC3mAQAvD_BwE">Udemy</a>, 
                            and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeCademy</a>. After some time with using these platforms I decided to try to learn the MVT 
                            framework for Python called <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> I struggled to learn the framework but I learned how to.

                        Today I have put in a lot of work I have been actively uploading code to GitHub you can check out all of the code here Braiden Gole's
                        GitHub Profile. I have source code written in C, C++, C#, Python, CPython, Html, Css, Javascript. The content of the code is mainly the implementation
                        of algorithms and fun projects and is constantly being updated with new code.

                        All of the code is written behind a Alienware M15 Windows 10 PC.

                            <b>Software Engineering Technology (SET)</b>
                            After programming by myself for a while I decided to take things to the next level by signing up for the <a href="https://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/software-engineering-technology">Software Engineering Technology</a>
                            program at <a href="https://www.conestogac.on.ca/">Conestoga College</a>. I had a great experience in the program I got to learn the C programming language, C++, Batch, operating system 
                            fundamentals, user interface/user experience, DFD(Data Flow Diagrams), Data structures, SRS Fundamentals, UML Diagrams and more.
                        </p>

                        <b>Computer Programming and Analysis (CPA)</b>
                        Things were a little too challenging in Software Engineering so I switched to the <a href="https://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/computer-programming-and-analysis">Computer Programming and Analysis</a> program at Conestoga College. 
                        This change has been beneficial because I got to collaborate with new people, technologies, and most importantly gave myself an oppertunity to continue
                        as a developer. I am really enjoying the program it is a lot of fun and more focused on Web, Mobile, and Desktop development. This program has many 
                        similarities, a partial difference between the two programs is that CPA will have a stronger focus on the design and layout and presentation of a project.
